Computer programming for Econ Students
======================================

Location

Ives 109, 2013/8/19-2013/8/23 8:30 - 5:00 p.m.

Goal
----
The goal of this class is to showcase high-performance techniques and tools for economics students. The goal is NOT to teach a full 
course on SAS, Stata, etc. - there are other classes for that. We will teach just enough of each programming language to
be able to highlight additional techniques. This course is designed to open your eyes to the possibilities, scratching
the surface, but not diving into any particular depths. Follow-on short courses may solve those needs. For
specific programming languages, we point to offerings elsewhere on campus, for instance at [CISER](http://www.ciser.cornell.edu).
