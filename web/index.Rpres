High-performance computing for Economists
========================================================
transition: fade
author: Lars Vilhuber, with John M. Abowd, Rick Mansfield, Flavio Stanchi, Hautahi Kingi, Sida Peng
date: 2015/8/17-2015/8/19 

**Time**: *9:00 - 5:00 p.m.* (we will typically end earlier)

**Location**: *Ives 109*

Goal
========================================================
The goal of this class is to showcase high-performance techniques and tools for economics students. The goal is NOT to teach a full
course on SAS, Stata, etc. - there are other classes for that. We will teach just enough of each programming language to
be able to highlight additional techniques (for SAS and Matlab, we will teach specialized workshops on each in more depth)
 This course is designed to open your eyes to the possibilities, scratching
the surface, but mostly not diving into any particular depths. Follow-on short courses may solve those needs. For
specific programming languages, we point to offerings elsewhere on campus, for instance at [CISER](http://www.ciser.cornell.edu).

Target group
------------
Second year Ph.D. in Economics or other social sciences.

Requirements
